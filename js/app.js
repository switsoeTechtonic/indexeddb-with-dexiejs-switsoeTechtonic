// Now that you’ve cloned your project lets start by testing our code. Let's start live
//server and open up our project in the browser. Open up your console and you should see
//some logs outputting book objects. These object are predefined in books.json and added to
//our database called library_database in indexedDB. We can also navigate to the
//application tab in the chrome console (storage in firefox) and take a look at the indexedDB
//storage We created this for you in indexedDB.js if you feel inclined to take a look.

// We've populated the table so the UI reflects what's currently in our local
// library_database in indexedDB.  We've logged the database above so you can see exactly
// what you're working with


// 1.) Now add functionality to remove a row  which will need remove the object from the books store in
//indexedDB database as well as the UI once the delete operation is complete. This will take some
//effort on the UI. Use the title as your UID (Unique identifier) which you can find in the application console
//in Chrome (storage in Firefox).

// 2.) From here we want to be able to add a book. Hook up the form below the table to add a
//book to the books store in indexedDB and auto-update the table without refreshing the page.
//Hint: This add operation is on the front page of DexieJS.  Both is and Table.put() can be
// used to add this book.

// 3.) Now make each table row editable and update the database when the edit is complete. This will
//take a lot of effort from the html to the js. Use the title as your UID (Unique identifier)
//which you can find in the application console
